## GAMBIT CHALLENGE

This is my take on the Gambit challenge. I went with option 1 and option 2 to a degree, i present the data in a mobile friendly way(although, in a very simple way.)



## implementation

I used nodejs to parse the data and then save it in a json format(json file.) It would/should be very simple to save it to a database if that would ever be part of this challenge.
I display the data both backend and frontend, where i use react and some simple css to make it mobile friendly.



## Thoughts of improvement

If i would to remake this at somepoint in the future, i would like to make it easier, more efficient to parse the data, as i feel this is quite clunky. 



## Demo

Hosted on AWS which i always have used, for such things as discordbots or websites in the past and present. The words BACKEND and TEXT-FEED is clickable.
