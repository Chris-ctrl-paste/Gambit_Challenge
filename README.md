## GAMBIT CHALLENGE

This is my take on the Gambit challenge. I went with option 1 and option 2 to a degree, i present the data in a mobile friendly way(although, in a very simple way.)



## implementation

I used nodejs to parse the data and then save it in a json format(json file.) It would/should be very simple to save it to a database if that would ever be part of this challenge.
I display the data both backend and frontend, where i use react and some simple css to make it mobile friendly.



## Thoughts of improvement

If i would to remake this at somepoint in the future, i would like to make it easier, more efficient to parse the data, as i feel this is quite clunky. 



## Demo

Hosted on AWS which i always have used, for such things as discordbots or websites in the past and present. The words BACKEND and TEXT-FEED is clickable.

Note: Frontend is only display in a mobile friendly way. Backend is basically Medusa from the greek mythology, if you choose to view it on mobile, it is on your own risk.
For the best view of the backend, i recommend the JSONVIEWER extension, unfortunately, this is a thing i totally missed, because of said extension.
